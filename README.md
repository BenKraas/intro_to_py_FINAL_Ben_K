# Final project by Ben Kraas for the course "Introduction to programming and applied statistics" in python

## Overview:
This is my final project for this course. All code was written by me unless specified.

**I will not commit after midnight 12th September 2022** so that you can pull this code directly from github.
You can of course verify this at [link](https://github.com/KtRNofficial/intro_to_py_FINAL_Ben_K/commits/main "Github commits")  


This project consists of some additional scripts which are necessary for the project to function:

* bk_config.py can be used to change the working dir (data origin) and the data dir (save location)

* bk_functions.py is a collection of functions and classes used in most tasks. Some of these functions are only used once, others repeatedly. My goal with this was a useful, central collection of functions and classes to streamline workflow.

I would **highly** appreciate it if you left comments in the code and committed them to github. 
Maybe use triple ### so I can identify your comments more easily.
This way I can identify the mistakes I inevitably made and grow my programming skills.

## Getting started:

There is only one thing you have to pay attention to:
If you clone the repo, make sure the folders you clone it into do not have whitespace in their names.

I have no idea why this breaks the pd.import_csv() but it does (for me)

EDIT: 
I have now attempted a fix - this is not tested yet
