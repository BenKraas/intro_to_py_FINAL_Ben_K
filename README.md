# Final Project for the Introduction to Statistics in Python

## Overview:
This is my final project for this course.

All code was written by me unless specified.

This project consists of some additional scripts which are necessary for the project to function:

bk_config.py can be used to change the working dir (data origin) and the data dir (save location)

bk_functions.py is a collection of functions and classes used in most tasks. Some of these functions are only used once, others repeatedly. My goal with this was a useful, central collection of functions and classes to streamline workflow.

## Getting started:

There is only one thing you have to pay attention to:
If you clone the repo, make sure the folders you clone it into do not have whitespace in their names.

I have no idea why this breaks the pd.import_csv() but it does (for me)

EDIT: 
I have now attempted a fix - this is not tested yet
