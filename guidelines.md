# Final Project

## General Guidelines

To complete this course you need to **pass** the final project.

The final project consists of **eight** (8) tasks that may include more than one
subtasks. The description of each task is provided in the corresponding `.py` files.

Some tasks use external data (.csv or .geojson). Place all the external files in the same
folder with your scirpts. Use this folder as your working directory (workdir).

Everything you need is available of moodle, except the air-quality data we
used in lecture 10. Download these data manually from moodle and unzip them in your workdir.

## Deadline

The submission deadline is **12.09.2022 23:59**.

## Grading

- Your grade is calculated by how well you did in **all** eight tasks.
